# Explanation

## Philosophers
```bash
python3 create_philosophers.py MIN MAX
```
and replace MIN, resp. MAX by the minimal resp. maximal number of philosophers.
That means, if you want to create files for 3,4,5 philosophers do:
```bash
python3 create_philosophers.py 3 5
```

## IJ and Pnueli
The range has to be manually modified in the script (first/second line of the file).
